1. Characterizing the listener's audio aura:
By calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability of the listener’s top 100 songs, we can roughly describe their audio aura. For example:

Energy: medium-high → energetic songs

Valence: medium → songs are moderately happy

Danceability: high → songs are easy to dance to

So, the listener’s audio aura could be described as energetic, moderately happy, and danceable.

2. Why this might not be representative:

Averages hide extremes; very sad and very happy songs may cancel out.

Top 100 songs may not represent all listening habits.

All songs are treated equally, ignoring how often each song is played.

3. Better ways to calculate the aura:

Weighted averages using play counts.

Clustering songs by mood to find dominant moods.

Include more data beyond the top 100 songs and consider additional features like tempo or key.
