Web Development – CS50x Final Project
Introduction

This project is my final project for CS50x. It is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my work, skills, and experience as a web developer. A portfolio website is an important tool for any developer or designer, because it allows potential clients, employers, or collaborators to quickly understand what I can do and what I have built in the past.

The main goal of this project was to create a professional, modern, and responsive website that presents my profile in a clear and attractive way. I wanted to design something that is not only functional, but also visually appealing, with a dark theme style that highlights the content.

Website Structure

The website is divided into four main sections: About, Resume, Portfolio, and Contact. On the left side of the website, there is also a sidebar containing my profile picture, name, role, and personal information.

About Section

This section introduces me as a web developer.

Visitors can immediately understand who I am and what my role is.

The sidebar shows my email, phone number, birthday, location, and links to my social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram).

Resume Section

In this part, I present my education background and work experience.

I included three levels of education: High School of Art and Design, New York Academy of Art, and University School of the Arts.

For experience, I listed my roles as a Web Designer, Art Director, and Creative Director.

At the bottom of this section, I added a Skills section, where I use progress bars to show my abilities in Web Design, Graphic Design, Branding, and WordPress. This visual representation makes it easy for visitors to quickly see my strengths.

Portfolio Section

This is the most important part of the website.

Here I displayed my projects in different categories: Web design, Applications, and Web development.

Each project is shown in a card layout with a thumbnail image, project name, and category.

Some examples of the projects include Finance, Orizon, Fundo, Brawlhalla, DSM, MetaSpark, Summary, Task Manager, and Arrival.

The portfolio is clean, modern, and easy to browse, allowing visitors to see the variety of work I can do.

Contact Section

This part includes a contact form where users can fill in their name, email, and message to send me directly.

This section is important because it makes the website interactive and useful for communication.

Design and Technologies

I built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML was used to structure the content of the pages.

CSS was used to style the website and give it a dark modern theme. The design uses consistent colors, rounded corners, shadows, and typography to create a professional look.

JavaScript was used for interactive features such as filtering the portfolio items.

The website is also responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes. This was very important because many people visit websites using their phones. I made sure the layout looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

What I Learned

Through this project, I improved my knowledge in front-end development and web design. Some of the key things I learned include:

How to organize a website into clear and meaningful sections.

How to design with a user-friendly navigation system.

How to create a responsive layout with modern CSS.

How to use JavaScript to add interactivity and make the portfolio dynamic.

How to present my personal information and projects in a professional way.

Future Improvements

Although the website is complete, there are many ways I can improve it in the future:

Add a blog section where I can share articles and tutorials about web development.

Connect the contact form to a backend so that messages are sent directly to my email.

Add more animations and transitions to make the design more engaging.

Include a downloadable resume in PDF format.

Improve accessibility for users with disabilities.

Conclusion

This personal portfolio website is my CS50x final project. It is more than just a school project for me—it is a professional tool that I can use to present myself to the world. I am proud of how it looks and how it works, and I believe it represents my skills well.

By completing this project, I not only practiced what I learned in the course, but also created something that will help me in my career as a web developer. This experience showed me how to combine design, coding, and creativity into a single functional product.
